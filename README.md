## Aligment rules

- The variable for the dataset is `df`.
- naming features:
  -  `snake_case`
      -  Kidhome -> kid_home
  -  bad: sum_all_mnt
  -  good: mnt_all_sum
  -  better: total_amount_spent
- for each cell/process, write a comment on what you are doing.
  - remove the comment if they are no longer relevant!
- name your functions meaningfully.
